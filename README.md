## Introduction

**Natural Language Processing (NLP)** is a branch of AI that enables machines to understand, interpret, and generate human language. It combines computational linguistics with machine learning and deep learning to process text and speech data.

Applications of NLP include:
- **Text Classification**
- **Sentiment Analysis**
- **Machine Translation**
- **Named Entity Recognition (NER)**
- **Speech Recognition**
- **Question Answering**

## Key Concepts

1. **Tokenization**: The process of splitting text into individual words or sentences, called tokens.
2. **Part-of-Speech Tagging (POS)**: Identifying the grammatical category (noun, verb, etc.) of each word in a sentence.
3. **Named Entity Recognition (NER)**: Identifying and categorizing entities such as people, locations, organizations in text.
4. **Stemming and Lemmatization**: Reducing words to their base or root forms.
5. **Word Embeddings**: Representing words as vectors in a continuous vector space (e.g., Word2Vec, GloVe, BERT).
6. **Sequence Models**: Techniques such as RNNs, LSTMs, and Transformers used to process sequences of text.

## NLP Techniques

1. **Text Classification**:
   Text classification is the process of categorizing text into predefined groups. This technique is commonly used for tasks like spam detection, sentiment analysis, and topic labeling.

   - Algorithms: Naive Bayes, Support Vector Machines (SVM), Transformers (BERT).

2. **Sentiment Analysis**:
   Sentiment analysis is the task of analyzing the sentiment of text, typically classifying it as positive, negative, or neutral.

3. **Named Entity Recognition (NER)**:
   NER is used to locate and classify named entities such as people, organizations, and locations in a body of text.

4. **Machine Translation**:
   Machine translation is the task of automatically converting text from one language to another. Neural Machine Translation (NMT) is a popular approach using models like seq2seq and Transformers.

5. **Text Summarization**:
   Text summarization reduces a large body of text into a shorter version while retaining the key information. There are two main types: extractive and abstractive summarization.

6. **Speech Recognition**:
   Speech recognition converts spoken language into text. This involves processing audio signals and mapping them to corresponding words.
